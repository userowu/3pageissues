        <p id = "ls_text"> Live streaming has become popular, especially since the pandemic
          hit. Streaming has become such a major point in pop culture, and many have
          resorted it to feel a sense of community in a time where we have been so isolated.
          From being a streamer to being a viewer, streaming has become prevalent.</p>

        <p id = "ls_text"> Imane Anys, better known as Pokimane
           is a Moroccan-Canadian Twitch streamer and YouTuber.
            She is best known for her live streams on Twitch,
            broadcasting video game content, most notably
            in League of Legends and Fortnite. She is
            currently the most-followed female streamer
            on the platform. She is a member and co-founder
            of OfflineTV, an online social entertainment group of
            content creators. In her career, she has faced countless years of harassment from the streaming
            community to the Youtube community. Commentary videos criticizing her character down to the bone
            would come out, trying to justify any mistake of hers as an indication of her hurtful character.
            People would downplay her accomplishments down to her good looks
            and to "simps," which is simply false because she has a major fanbase of many supportive women.
            She has been told constantly to show her b0obs on camera, to do explicit content, but despite
            her entire image being against that, many still boil her down to someone who doesn't deserve human respect and decency -- in their eyes, a girl.

        <img id = "girlsmain" src = "kyedae.png" alt = "kyedae">
        <h1 id = "ls_text"> Kyedae </h1>
        <p id = "ls_text"> Kyedae Shymko, better known mononymously as Kyedae, is a
          Japanese-Canadian Twitch streamer and content creator of 100 Thieves. She is engaged to e-sports player TenZ.
          Kyedae was introduced through streams of her then-boyfriend TenZ, where
          she learned how to play Valorant. She began streaming on her
          own as she became more skilled in the game, eventually meeting
          several gamers including Offline TV and Friends and grew her own following.
          Kyedae is known for her Valorant gameplays where she is aiming to reach
          Radiant. She also regularly streams with her fianc√© TenZ, where her
          offbeat, dirty sense of humor contrasts with TenZ's cleaner image. She
          joined 100 Thieves in April 2021.

          Kyedae has been the victim of many death threats
          and people who tell her that she is only successful because of
          her boyfriend. She consistently strives to break stereotypes against women
          being carried by men in the gaming industry, by streaming her solo queue
          competitive games and making content that proves she belongs in the rank she is in.
          Kyedae is also a very straightforward person who does not take bullsh*t from anyone,
          reinforcing that women are not pushovers and should be treated seriously.

        <h1 id = "ls_text"> Valkyrae </h1>
        <p id = "ls_text"> Rachell Hofstetter, better known as Valkyrae, is an
           American Internet personality. She has been YouTube's most-watched female streamer
           since 2020, and appeared on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list in 2022. She was named "Gaming Creator
          of the Year" by Adweek, and has won a Game Award and a Streamy Award.

          Hofstetter is a co-owner of 100 Thieves, an esports and an apparel company,
          and has been a content creator for the brand since 2018. Hofstetter is an advocate
          for women in online gaming, sometimes playing games on all-female teams.

          Despite being a very "unproblematic" streamer and person who does
          not involve themselves with "drama" in the gaming community, Valkyrae
          receives harsh criticism about her character and online persona. Many often look
          down on her because some think her to be too "childish." Valkyrae is
          a great inspiration to women because she holds powerful positions in gaming, as
          one of the co-owners of 100 Thieves, a gaming organization, and a Forbes Under 30
          leader.  </p>
